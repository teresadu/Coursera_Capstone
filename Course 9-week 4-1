The Battle of Suburbs
Choose a location in Toronto to open a new coffee shop

1. BUSINESS PROBLEM

Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,954,024 as of 
July 2018. Now there is an investor plan to open a new coffee shop in Toronto. So we are assigned to help him to create 
a comprehensive marketing program. Since there are lots of restaurants in Toronto we will try to detect locations that 
are not already crowded with coffee shops. We would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming 
that first two conditions are met.
